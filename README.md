# Binary Search

### Objective
In this project, our main goal is to understand the binary search algorithm.


### Problem
Create a doubly linked list corresponding to the following diagram and binary search function to search 9 value.

### Implementation
* Create a doubly linked list where the data is an integer.
* implement a binary search function to search for the target, and  print the number of iterations it took to find the target value.
* In the main method, call the linear Search function target value of 9.

 >Note the number of iterations in this and the previous project
