# Binary Search

### Objective
In this project, our main goal is to understand the binary search algorithm.


### Problem
Create a doubly linked list corresponding to the following diagram and binary search function to search for the value of 9.

### Implementation
* In the DoublyLinkedList class, implement a `binary search` function to search for the target, and  print the number of iterations it took to find the target value.
* In the `main` method, call the binary Search function with 9 as a target.

 >Note the number of iterations in this and the previous project
```java
   public void binarySearch(int target) {
          /*add your code here*/
   }
```
```java
public class Main{
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*add your code here*/
   }
}
```
